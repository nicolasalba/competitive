The following functions are all multiplicative functions, where \( p \) is a prime number and \( k \) is a positive integer:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The constant function: \( I(p^k) = 1 \).
    \item The identity function: \( \text{Id}(p^k) = p^k \).
    \item The power function: \( \text{Id}_a(p^k) = p^{ak} \), where \( a \) is a constant.
    \item The unit function: \( \chi(p^k) = [ p^k = 1 ] \).
    \item The divisor function: \( \sigma_a(p^k) = \sum_{i=0}^k p^{ai} \), denoting the sum of the \( a \)-th powers of all the positive divisors of the number.
    \item The MÃ¶bius function: \( \mu(p^k) = [ k = 0 ] - [ k = 1 ] \).
    \item Euler's totient function: \( \varphi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1} \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note:} \([P]\) refers to the boolean expression, i.e., \([P] = 1\) when \( P \) is true, and \( 0 \) otherwise.
