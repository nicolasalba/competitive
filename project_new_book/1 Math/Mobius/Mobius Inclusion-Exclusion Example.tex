How many numbers are there less than or equal to n that are free of squares?. Contrainsts: $1 <= n <= 10^{12}$
\newline\newline
Change the statement to count the reverse and then sustract: How many numbers are ... that can be divided by a square of a prime. So the answer will be $n -$ Summatory with Inclusion-Exclusion of $f(prime)$
\newline
$$ f(prime) = floor(\frac{n}{p*p}) $$
\newline
So in those cases of summatory with primes, you can use Mobius to adding or substracting. Final answer is

$$ n - \Sigma^{\sqrt{n}}_{i=1} \mu(i)\left\lfloor \frac{n}{i^2} \right\rfloor $$ 
\newline
Or in programming terms:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, frame=None]
long long ans = n;
for (int i =1;i<=sqrt(n);i++) {
    ans -= mo[i] * n/(i*i);
}
\end{lstlisting}
