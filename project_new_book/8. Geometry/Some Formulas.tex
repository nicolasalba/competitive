\subsection*{Volume of Glass with Water (Volumen del Vaso)}
Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( p \) is the height of the water
    \item \( r_1 \) is the big radius at the water's surface
    \item \( r_2 \) is the small radius of the base
\end{itemize}

The volume of the glass with water is given by:

\[
\text{Volume} = p \cdot \pi \cdot \frac{ \left( r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_1 \cdot r_2 \right)}{3}
\]

\subsection*{Heron's Formula}
Finding the area of a triangle by the length of its sides, also applicable for points using Euclidean distance. You can use the following code to get the area; if the square root is negative, then the triangle is not valid.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, frame=None]
long double triangle_area(long double a, long double b, long double c) {
    long double s = (a + b + c) / 2;
    return sqrtl(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Sine and Cosine Laws}
Let \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) be the sides of the triangle, and \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) the angles opposite to these sides, respectively.

The Sine Law:
\[
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}
\]

The Cosine Law:
\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cdot \cos C
\]
